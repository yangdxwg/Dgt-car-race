This is instruction for the racing game

To go forward press "w"
To turn press "a/d"
To reverse press "s"
To brake/slow down hold "space bar"

Note:
- If the car flip, it does not automatically flip back and the game will need to be re-started
- If the car hits an object, stops, and need to go backwards, the speedometer on the bottom left MUST read "0 km/h" before the car can start reversing. 
- Drifts can be done by holding "a" and "d" while accelerating, practice is needed. There is an additional drifting practice track in the middle right of the map.  
- The red loop can only be used at speed over 160 - 170 km/h for the car to fully loop around.
